      <h1>Who is Dr. Phil?</h1>
      <h2>Phillip Calvin McGraw (born September 1, 1950), also known as Dr. Phil, is an American
        television personality, author and the host of the television show Dr. Phil.
        He holds a doctorate in clinical psychology, though ceased renewing his license to practice
        psychology in 2006.</br>
        </br>
        McGraw frequently advises individuals to seek professional help, particularly
        psychotherapy. A 2016 study at Ohio State University found that viewers were more likely to seek professional
        mental health care for themselves and their children after seeing McGraw deal with similar
        issues on the Dr. Phil show. The study attributed this phenomenon to viewers tendency to form a
        parasocial bond with McGraw through watching the show, and have increased belief in their ability to seek help.
