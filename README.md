**Dr. Phil's Personality Test** : Starting to grasp what JavaScript is about.

******************************************************

When I first started learning JavaScript, I found myself lost in an impossible to escape **Tutorial Hell**.
I didn't understand why, nor how JavaScript worked.
_How was I supposed to make a page **interactive** with variables and **operators**? _
So I thought that maybe if I created a project all by myself, it'd be easier for me to see the bigger picture, so I did.
This isn't my proudest creation, but this is where **I started**.

Its origin is in a small test I found online, which guesses your personality based on your habits. 
The page is not responsive, and I didnÂ´t spend more than 30 minutes on the design, because it's main purpose was to practice JavaScript.
